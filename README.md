# Joke Generator

The Joke Generator is a small application that generates a random joke. The user may select one of four categories at a time: Programming, Misc, Dark Humor, or Random. Although this is a small application I chose to implement Redux to familiarize myself with the technology. This app is a React frontend and Node backend using an Express server.
